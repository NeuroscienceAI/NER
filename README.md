NER has recieved eight reviews and all of the reviews are above borderline accecpt:

NER is the first dimensionality reduction method which align 3D latenct dynamics with movements.
Left: Hand velocities of center-out reaching in eight directions (colors)
Right: Corresponding 3D latent dynamics

FAQ:
1. Have you optimized the hyper-parametrs of CEBRA?
2. What is the limination of NER relative to CEBRA?
3. What kinds of data are appropriate for NER?
